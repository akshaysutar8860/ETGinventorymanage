# ETGinventorymanagegement system
This is an enventory management system project which can help to grocery owner's to manage their stocks and sails
This project mainly concerned about creating and managing inventory
Sometimes it is hard to manage each and every grocery at human level
So this will help lot to reduce human pressure
1.first upon I created enventory containing 30 products each product had 5 attributes as following
  a)name b)price c)stocks d)expiry date e) discount on online purchase
2.I also created section to add new inventory/stocks to the existing dictionary
  Which get input from owner and add into it
3.sail section is create to manage sails this section demands I'd of a product and as per key gives all information of product
4.as one item purchased stocks value decreased by one
5.if customer buys any product through upi their is special discount using some calculations
6.Then we import json library which convert dictionary into string using dupms which will later helpful to 
  File handling then after I used file handling an creates json file which further read using file handling
7.This process In 6 and 7 would be same for sails and record 
Then finally we convert this json file into dictionary by using loads function
So this is a simple inventory management project help to manage and sort inventory
